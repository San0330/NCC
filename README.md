# 📝 MyTodoApp

A simple Todo List application built with **ASP.NET MVC** (no database) using **Tailwind CSS** for styling.  
Tasks are stored in memory using a static list and reset each time the application restarts.

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer**  
> This project is intended **for teaching purposes only**. It serves as a basic introduction to the **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** pattern using **ASP.NET Core MVC**, aimed at helping students understand the structure and flow of MVC applications.  
> It does **not use a database** and stores data in memory, which means all data is lost when the application stops.
